    <h3 id = "Center">About me</h3>
    <p>Suprisingly, even though I am into computers and gaming, and am good at programming, no one in my family except my grandpa has any idea what I'm talking about when I explain to them what I'm doing. Also, I never had even heard what a computer was until I was 6 or 7. When I was 9, my dad showed me a video about with the creators of Facebook, Twitter and a lot of other big names in websites talking about programming. He signed me up for a coding lesson on the site <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. It was to hard for me and I decided not to do it anymore. Then, when I was 10, and we moved to Canada I decided to try it again. I got into it and we found some classes I could take at <a href = "https://www.robo-geek.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robo-geek</a>. I learned python and some other stuff there. Also in Canada, one of my friends was into drawing a lot and I started too. Then I discovered the <a href = "https://www.adafruit.com/product/659" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adafruit Flora</a>: a microcontroller that you can sew onto clothes. With that I found my passion for wearable electronics and even now ideas are still flowing like water from an automated sprinkling system.</p>
